## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your Desktop_
* _Install Node._
* _Type the command 'npm install' into your command line. This will install the technologies needed by the dev environment._
* _Set up an account with ExchangeRate-API to get your free API key._
* _Create a file in the top level of the currency-exchanger directory called '.env' and store 'YOUR-API-KEY' there in this format `API_KEY='YOUR-API-KEY'`_
* _Use the command 'npm run build' to build your project._
* _Use the command 'npm run start' to build your project and start a live server._
* _Use the command 'npm run lint' to use ESLint on your project._
* _Use the command 'npm run test' to use Jest to test your logic. You will need to set up a `__tests__` directory in the top level of your project with files for each test suite you would like to run. These suites will utilize import and export statements to link the js files you would like to test._


## Known Bugs

* _If you enter a number instead of a letter, you will get a TypeError. This just means you need to enter a number in the field._
